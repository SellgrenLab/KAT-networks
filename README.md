# Abstract

 Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by an excessive loss of
 synapses. Recent data suggest that this is due to increased microglia-mediated synaptic
 pruning. Here, we utilize human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived models to show that
 kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous NMDA-receptor antagonist observed to be increased
 in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia, reduces neuronal activity and promote
 microglial uptake of synapses. In a human brain organoid model, we confirm reduced
 microglia-mediated synaptic pruning upon inhibiting the endogenous KYNA production. To
 verify our experimental data in a clinical context, we integrate large-scale transcriptomic and
 genetic datasets and show that KYNA-producing kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs) enrich
 for genes governing synaptic activity and genetic risk variants for schizophrenia. Together,
 these results link genetic risk variants for schizophrenia to elevated production of KYNA and
 excessive activity-dependent synaptic pruning, while implicating pharmacological inhibition
 of KATs as a strategy to avoid synapse loss in schizophrenia.
